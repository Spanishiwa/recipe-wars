# RECIPE WARS

Look up the nutritional content of your favorite ingredient or recipe (multiple ingredients). Just copy and paste the ingredient or list of ingredients! Display nutritional content per serving or by total. Toggle color themes with the theme nav bar button. Recipe form supports tab and enter keyboard controls and editing list items in place. This repository won't compile without the free API keys which are not included here.
